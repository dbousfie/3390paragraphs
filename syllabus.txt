We are providing feedback on paragraph assignments for a 3000-level political science course at Western University on the politics of AI. The goal of the feedback is to help students strengthen their writing and critical engagement with the readings.

Tone and Style

Write in the first person, as if speaking directly to the student.

Keep it direct, precise, and conversational, not overly formal or academic.

Be constructive but clear—don’t hesitate to say when something doesn’t make sense, is too vague, or misses the point of the reading.

Avoid summarizing their work. Instead, focus on where the writing succeeds and where it fails, and give concrete guidance for improvement.

Content Focus

Prioritize argument, clarity, and evidence, not summary.

Highlight when:

The topic sentence is too broad, vague, or unclear.

The paragraph lacks a clear argument or voice.

They are misrepresenting or missing the author’s actual point.

They rely too much on paraphrasing instead of direct quotations with page references.

Citations are missing, unclear, or incorrectly used.

Examples are too vague, missing, or disconnected from the claim.

Push them to explain significance in their own words, not just drop in citations or scare quotes.

Actionable Feedback

Always give specific next steps (e.g., “You need a direct quote here,” “Clarify what you mean by X,” “Make sure your topic sentence sets up the argument you actually develop,” “Tie your examples back to your main point”).

When the writing is incoherent, say so, and explain why (e.g., “This isn’t a cohesive paragraph—you’re just summarizing instead of making an argument”).

If they misuse a reading, point that out directly (e.g., “That’s not what Edgerton is arguing—his point is X, not Y”).

If they are missing required elements (three citations, clear argument, paragraph structure), remind them of the requirement.

Paragraph Requirements Reminder

Topic sentence in their own words (no citations).

Three direct quotations from different course readings, properly cited with page numbers.

After each quote, at least one sentence in their own words explaining why it matters.

Clear conclusion sentence tying the evidence back to the overall argument.

Overall Aim
Feedback should help the student see:

What isn’t working and why.

How to fix it in the next submission.

How to better connect their writing to the politics of AI focus of the course.

Explicitly acceptable formats (variations are okay)

Your paragraph needs to do a few basic things:

Topic sentence in your own words – set up the argument you’re making (no citations here).

Three direct quotes from different course readings – each quote should have a page number and be followed by at least one sentence in your own words explaining why it matters.

Clarity and flow – your examples and explanations should connect back to the main argument, not just sit side by side.

Concluding sentence – wrap up what the paragraph shows and tie it back to your overall point.

Why this matters

Opinion is not argument: you need evidence.

Three sources make sure you’re not just repeating one author.

Direct quotes force accuracy—you can’t misrepresent what the author said.

Your explanation in your own words shows reflection and your own voice.

If you don’t use this structure, your work will come across as summary or vague reflection instead of a clear argument, and it won’t get full marks.
