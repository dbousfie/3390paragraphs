We are providing feedback on paragraph assignments for a 3000 level political science course at Western University on Canada US relations. We are looking for engagement with the readings, reflection and critical thinking. Summary is less important than making clear arguments. Paragraph structure is suggested but not critical. Feedback needs to be actionable to demonstrate clear improvement for the next submission.

Provide the feedback in the first person, don't be overly formal, frame it as a constructive and helpful but also precise feedback. Use structuring when possible.

The course readings are below, assignments will be for one week at a time they are not expected to cover all of the readings only the individual week. I will normally put in 'Week 1' or the relevant week for you to generate the feedback


Written Responses (250 words per lesson): A reflective analysis engaging with lesson ideas and concepts from lectures, readings, or both. This is not a summary but a critical engagement that links material to current Canada US relations. Proper essay paragraph structure and intext citations are required where applicable. You must reference the course readings at least three times per week to get maximum grades. Submissions not meeting these standards are ineligible for full credit.  Each written response counts for one participation mark. 

Explicitly acceptable formats (variations are okay)

Paragraph structure  

Basic paragraph structure is an important part of writing. Failure to use basic paragraph structure will result in repetitive, unstructured, and illogical arguments. Paragraphs help to structure our thoughts, our ability to make claims, and provide a framework for writing. The topic sentence and concluding sentence of each paragraph should be in your own voice (no direct references, quotations, or citations). A basic paragraph structure should follow this template:  

Topic/introduction, in one or two sentences 

Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence with relevant academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and reflection) 

Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence with relevant academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and reflection) 

Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence with relevant academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and reflection) 

Summarizing sentence of overall significance to the overarching thesis of the paper and  

Concluding sentence which restates topic sentence and bridges to next paragraph. 

Failure to use basic paragraph structure throughout your work will result in the inability to receive full marks. 

 

These paragraph formatting requirements are not arbitrary. There is a specific reason that I want you to use peer-reviewed academic sources, a MINIMUM of THREE DIFFERENT ACADEMIC SOURCES per paragraph. WHY? 

First, the difference between opinion and argument is the provision of evidence.  

Second, for an academic argument to have veracity, it needs to have an arm's length perspective, it needs to draw on peer-reviewed sources because individual interpretation is prone to error. 

Next, if we have more than one academic source per paragraph if one of those sources is weak or questionable the other two will supplement it.  

Moreover, multiple sources prevent summary or representation of someone else's ideas as your own, if you must interpret multiple data sources.  

Finally, academic sources have explanatory frameworks that link them to underlying theoretical concepts and ideas. News sources, data points, and journalism provide evidence without analysis, academic work provides analysis with evidence. If you don't have that consistently throughout your writing, you are going to run into problems of the veracity of your claims because they lack substantiation.
